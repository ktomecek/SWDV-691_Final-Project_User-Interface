SWDV 691_Final Project_User Interface

## Title:
uforme.com

## Problem:
Most dating sites do single matches, for example, If you like someone that is 40, is divorced, and has no kids, that is the only match you get.  They claim to have complex algorithms, but the results show otherwise.  My application will allow you to have multiple match combinations at the same time and allow you to dismiss results instead of perpetually showing you the same people.

## Project:
This is the Final Project for SWDV 691.  In this repository, all the user front end components will be stored.
